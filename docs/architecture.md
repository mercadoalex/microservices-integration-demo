# Microservices Integration Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the microservices integration demo project. The project consists of two microservices, Service A and Service B, which communicate with each other and are tested using SOAPUI. The architecture is designed to demonstrate how microservices can be integrated and tested in a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Components

### Service A

- **Purpose**: Service A is responsible for [describe the functionality of Service A].
- **Technologies Used**: [List the technologies used, e.g., Node.js, Express, etc.]
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/service-a/endpoint1`: [Description of what this endpoint does]
  - `POST /api/service-a/endpoint2`: [Description of what this endpoint does]

### Service B

- **Purpose**: Service B handles [describe the functionality of Service B].
- **Technologies Used**: [List the technologies used, e.g., Node.js, Express, etc.]
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/service-b/endpoint1`: [Description of what this endpoint does]
  - `POST /api/service-b/endpoint2`: [Description of what this endpoint does]

## Communication

Service A and Service B communicate over HTTP. The integration points between the services are defined in their respective routes. The services can send requests to each other to perform operations and share data.

## Testing with SOAPUI

The integration of the microservices is tested using SOAPUI. The `soapui-project.xml` file located in the `src/tests` directory contains the configuration for the test cases, including requests and assertions to validate the responses from the services.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` automates the testing and building of the project whenever code is pushed or a pull request is created. This ensures that the integration between the microservices is continuously validated.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a robust framework for developing, testing, and deploying microservices. The integration of SOAPUI for testing and GitHub Actions for CI/CD enhances the reliability and maintainability of the project.
