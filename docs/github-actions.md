# GitHub Actions Setup for Microservices Integration Demo

This document provides an overview of the GitHub Actions setup for the Microservices Integration Demo project. It outlines the configuration of workflows, the purpose of each step, and how to customize the CI process.

## Overview

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository. In this project, we use GitHub Actions to automate the testing and building of our microservices whenever code is pushed or a pull request is created.

## Workflow Configuration

The workflow configuration is located in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file. Below is a breakdown of the key components of the workflow:

### 1. Triggering Events

The workflow is triggered by the following events:
- `push`: When code is pushed to the repository.
- `pull_request`: When a pull request is created or updated.

### 2. Jobs

The workflow consists of one job named `build`. This job runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.

### 3. Steps

The `build` job includes several steps:

- **Checkout Code**: This step uses the `actions/checkout` action to check out the repository code so that it can be used in the workflow.

- **Set Up Node.js**: This step uses the `actions/setup-node` action to set up the Node.js environment. It specifies the version of Node.js to use.

- **Install Dependencies**: This step runs `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies defined in the `package.json` file.

- **Run Tests**: This step executes the test suite using `npm test`. It ensures that all tests pass before merging code changes.

### Example Workflow File

Here is an example of what the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file might look like:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

## Customizing the Workflow

You can customize the workflow by modifying the `ci.yml` file. Here are some common customizations:

- **Change Node.js Version**: Update the `node-version` field in the `Set up Node.js` step to use a different version of Node.js.

- **Add More Steps**: You can add additional steps for tasks such as linting, building, or deploying your application.

- **Conditional Steps**: Use conditions to run specific steps only when certain criteria are met, such as only running deployment steps on the `main` branch.

## Conclusion

This GitHub Actions setup provides a robust foundation for continuous integration in the Microservices Integration Demo project. By automating the testing and building processes, you can ensure that your microservices remain stable and reliable as development progresses.
